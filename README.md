# Transporter
Surviving Mars mod

- late game wonder -Transporter - enables you to transfer colonists *from Earth to Mars* instantly without the need for a rocket

>I was thinking more in terms of Star Trek transporter, but that could work too

- maybe even add option to transfer colonists *from Mars* back *to Earth*, without rocket (think of Earthsick trait)

- plus some bonuses for tourists, since they don't need expensive rocket anymore to come over and visit

- maybe that statues in domes generate revenue every hour based on how many tourists are living (?) in that dome

- buildings
  - gift shop (@Draco18s)
    - consumes polymer, electronics
    - generates $M
    - satisfies Luxury, Shopping
